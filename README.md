1. Create one superclass HillStations and three subclasses Manali, Mussoorie, Gulmarg. Subclasses extend the superclass and override its location() and famousFor() method. i.call the location() and famousFor() method by the Parent class’, i.e. Hillstations class. As it refers to the base class object and the base class method overrides the superclass method; the base class method is invoked at runtime. ii.call the location() and famousFor() method by the all subclass’,and print accordingly.



2.Write a Java program that demonstrates method overriding by creating a superclass called Animal and two subclasses called Dog and Cat. ● The Animal class should have a method called makeSound(), which simply prints "The animal makes a sound." ● The Dog and Cat classes should override this method to print "TheCat/The dog meows/barks" respectively. ● The program should allow the user to create and display objects of each class.


3.Create abstract class vaccine.Create two variables age(int),nationality(String).create 2 concrete methods firstDose() and secondDose(). Scenario 1:user can take the first dose if the user is Indian and age is 18.After vaccination the user has to pay 250rs(which will be displayed on the console). Scenario 2: Users are eligible to take the second dose only after completing the first dose. Scenario 3: create abstract method boosterDose() in abstract class Vaccine.Create one implementation class vaccinationSuccessful, where implement boosterDose() method. Create main class vaccination and invoke all methods accordingly. [Hint:Create constructor to initialize variables age and nationality,Use flow control(Ifelse) to check condition]
